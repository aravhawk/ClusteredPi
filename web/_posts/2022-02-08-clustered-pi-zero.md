## Design
The design of the Clustered-Pi Zero is based on the Cray-1 supercomputer from 1970s.

## STL Files
The Model is made up of a couple STL files that you can print out to make your own Clustered-Pi:

- [Pi Holder](/assets/stl/clustered-pi/pi_holder.stl)
- [Top Panel](/assets/stl/clustered-pi/top_panel.stl)
- [Bottom Section](/assets/stl/clustered-pi/bottom_section.stl)
- [Cushion](/assets/stl/clustered-pi/cushion.stl)
- [Side Cushion](/assets/stl/clustered-pi/side_cushion.stl)

For a complete model you will need to print out:
- 12 x Pi Holders
- 12 x Bottom Secions
- 11 x Cushions
- 11 x Top Panels
- 11 x Side cushions (optional as currently the cable sticks out)

## Screws
I bought 20 x M2.5 Standoff for Pi Hat screws from Pimoroni so attach the Zero to the Pi Holder. The screws secure the Raspberry Pi Zero to the 3d printed pi holder.

## Raspberry Pi Zero 2
The Cluster is powered by a 12 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 (well, currently 6 Zero 2s and 6 Zero 1.2s).
